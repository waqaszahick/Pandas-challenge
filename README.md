# Pandas-challenge
Homework4-Pandas
This is my overall fourth and first 'Pandas' assignment. I was given a choice between ‘Heroes of Pymoli’ and ‘Py City School’, and I chose ‘Heroes of Pymoli’ for this 'Pandas' assignment. After creating a dedicated repository with the name ‘Pandas-challenge’ for this (Pandas) assignment, I created an additional folder with the name ‘HeroesOfPymoli’ in my 'GitHub Pandas' repository. For this assignment, I calculated the following:
* Total Number of Players for ‘Player Count’
* Number of Unique Items, Average Purchase Price, Total Number of Purchases and Total Revenue for ‘Purchasing Analysis’
* Percentage and Count of Male Players, Percentage and Count of Female Players and Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed for ‘Gender Demographics’

Calculated the following for 'Purchasing Analysis', on the basis of gender:
* Purchase Count, Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

Calculated the following for 'Age Demographics', each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.):
* Purchase Count, Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

Calculated the ‘Top Spenders’ and identified the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, based on the following, and then listed in a table: 
* SN
* Purchase Count
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value

Calculated ‘Most Popular Items’ and identified the 5 most popular items by purchase count, based on the following, and then listed in a table:
* Item ID
* Item Name
* Purchase Count
* Item Price
* Total Purchase Value

Calculated ‘Most Profitable Items’ and identified 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, based on the following, and then listed in a table:
* Item ID
* Item Name
* Purchase Count
* Item Price
* Total Purchase Value

In addition to the afore-mentioned tasks, I did the following:
* Used ‘Pandas Library’ and the ‘Jupyter Notebook’ to perform the above-mentioned tasks
* Commented my code (in ‘Jupyter Notebook’)
* Submitted a link to my ‘Jupyter Notebook’ with the viewable ‘Data Frames’

Apart from all above, the three observable trends based on the data are:
1. There are 179 'unique items'
2. The percentage of male players i.e more than 84%, is way more than the female players i.e. just over 14%
3. 'Average total purchase per person' for females i.e. $4.47 is more than 'average total purchase per person' for males i.e. $4.07, whereas the 'average total purchase per person' for other or non-disclosed gender is more than that of males and females i.e. $4.56
